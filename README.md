# Workshop Module 07

This repository is for learners on Corndel's DevOps apprenticeship.

You can't merge to the main branch unless you raise a pull request that passes the CI tests. Even if you're an admin.

Before the workshop you should complete all the set-up instructions in [before_you_start.md](./before_you_start.md).

During workshop 7 you'll be following the instructions in [during_workshop_7.md](./during_workshop_7.md).
